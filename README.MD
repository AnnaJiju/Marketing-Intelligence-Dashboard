# ðŸ“Š Marketing Intelligence Dashboard

An interactive BI dashboard built using **Streamlit** to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns (Facebook, Google, TikTok) in relation to business outcomes like revenue, orders, and profit.  

This dashboard helps stakeholders answer key questions:
- Which platform gives the best ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)?
- How are marketing spend and impressions converting into orders and revenue?
- What are the trends of profit margin and revenue per order over time?
- How do campaign-level metrics compare across platforms?
